    "## Crude death rate\n",
    "A crude rate is the unadjusted rate of a health outcome before any age standardization is applied. Crude death rate(CDR) (per 100000 people) can be calculate by using formula:\n",
    "            CDR = number of death / total population * 100000\n",
    "            \n",
    "For this exercise, total number of population of Uganda (is 42949080) and USA (is 334319671) are taken from the resource \"UN World Population Prospects (2022) — Population Estimates 1950-2021\". In WHO Standard Population — Table 1 in 'Ahmad OB, Boschi-Pinto C, Lopez AD, Murray CJ, Lozano R, Inoue M (2001). Age standardization of rates: a new WHO standard.', population distribution of each age group is given from; which we can calculate total population of each age group.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate CDR following steps are taken:\n",
    "1. Get the total number of population for each age group for both country.\n",
    "2. Get the number of death for each age group by using WHO Standard Population - Table 1.\n",
    "3. Get the total number of death by adding the death number from all age group.\n",
    "4. Calculate CDR by using formula: total number of death / total population * 100000\n",
    "\n",
    "## Age-standardized death rate\n",
    "Age standardization is a statistical method used to compare disease rates, or other health indicators, between populations while accounting for differences in their age structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "$ASDR = \\sum_{i} \\left( \\frac{{d_i}}{{n_i}}  \\times WHO_i \\right) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Where: \n",
    "- ${{d_i}}$ is the death rate for age group ${{i}}$ in the population of interest\n",
    "- ${{n_i}}$ is the total population of age group ${{i}}$ in the population of interest.\n",
    "- ${{WHO_i}}$ is the WHO standard population for age group ${{i}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since, age-specific death rate is given and we get age-group population standardized rate from WHO, we can easily calculate age-standardized death rate (ASDR) by using following steps:\n",
    "1. Multiply each age group death rate by the proportion of the corresponding age group in the standard population.\n",
    "2. After multiplying all age-specific rates by the corresponding proportion of each age group in the standard population, we sum the rates to obtain one number. This number is the age-standardized rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results:\n",
    "Crude Death Rate (per 100,000 people): \n",
    "- United States: 28.4 \n",
    "- Uganda: 28.7\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Age-Standardized Death Rate (per 100,000 people):\n",
    "- United States: 28.4\n",
    "- Uganda: 28.7\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as for the reasons for the differences between the calculated death rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Crude Death Rate: This rate simply calculates the total number of deaths in a population without any adjustment for the age structure of the population. Therefore, differences in crude death rates between the United States and Uganda may be influenced by various factors including differences in healthcare access, prevalence of risk factors, and overall health status of the populations.\n",
    "- Age-Standardized Death Rate: This rate adjusts for differences in age distributions between populations, allowing for a more accurate comparison of death rates. The differences in age-standardized death rates between the United States and Uganda may reflect variations in the age composition of the populations. For example, if one population has a higher proportion of elderly individuals, it may exhibit a higher age-standardized death rate due to the increased risk of mortality associated with aging. Additionally, variations in healthcare infrastructure and access to healthcare services may also contribute to differences in age-standardized death rates between countries.\n",
