# The following method should return the smallest value in the given array. If the array is empty then it should return 0.
# However, the last dev has made some bugs.  It seems it only works when the number "1" is the smallest value in the array - for all other cases the method fails
# 4 bugs have been identified within the code.
# See if you can find them all!
